Wow I have always wanted to use python but I have been learning so many helpful things in R! Why don't we use both with reticulate? I can use R to assign something.
```{R}
library(reticulate)
begin<-"This stuff"
```
Then I can use python to assign something else.
```{python}
mid="isn't that hard"
print(r.begin,mid)
```
Then I can use both to print it out by referring back to R with "r.". How cool! Can I refer back to python? I sure can.
```{R}
end="when you do it a lot"
cat(c(begin,py$mid, end))
```
What else can I do with the combined power of two awesome softwares and very basic skills?

Using one of my data sets from my project, "Exploratory Data Analysis", I can convert all 50 states to a vector. I had to take out the average of all states, you will see why later.
```{R}
library(knitr) 
library(tidyverse)
ex<-read_csv("week16_exercise.csv")
glimpse(ex)
ex<-ex%>%mutate(col=state)%>%select(col)
ex<-ex[-c(1), ]
avector <- as.vector(ex$col)
avector
```
But what if I want it in python? I can do that! And I can convert from a list to a string to do something very cool!
```{python}
df=r.avector
df=' '.join(df)
df=df.lower()
df
```
Then I use what I learned in my Bioinformatics class and I can count the number of times each letter in the alphabet shows up in the names of all 50 states.
```{python}
counts = {}            
for c in df:     
    if c in counts:    
        counts[c]+=1   
    else:
        counts[c]=1    
for c in counts:
    print(c, "appears", counts[c],"times")
```
Wow it seems A is the most popular letter and J and Z are the least popular!
